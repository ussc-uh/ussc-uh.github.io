## Card Memory Game

live at: https://ussc-uh.github.io/

## Code

- one HTML file which now includes both the CSS and JS code.
- `/images/cards` folder which has all the images of cards

## Logic

- While playing, if you click on image `3H` and `3C` one after another or vice versa, those will go back in the deck.
- images are also named `3C.png` AND `3H.png`.
